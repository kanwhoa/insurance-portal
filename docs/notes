For distributed, just chain the logins together then bounce back to the 
original URL
e.g.
http://www.site.com/user/register
http://www.site.com/auth/facebook
 ... Facebook login cycle
 if all okay...
http://services.site.com/auth/facebook
 ... Facebook login cycle
 if all okay...
http://www.site.com/ (logged in)


reasons why data is separate from content
 - bandwidth of content reduced
 - CDN (could have the same name, but have a proxy hit)
 - REST calls are tiny
 - may have regulatory reasons


Key problem is that we have to go through the auth URL in the browser
since it cannot work through XmlHttp/AJAX

Social connect on the feedback page is dumb. Should just offer service
over those channels.
